# *Have something done*

### What someone does for us

- We use ***have* + object + -*ed*** form when we talk about **someone doing something for us** which we ask or instruct them to do. 
- It **emphasises the process/action** rather than who performs it
- Example: *We’re **having** <u>the house painted</u> next week.* 
  - We are not going to paint the house ourselves. **Someone else will paint it**. The **emphasis is on the fact that the house is being painted** rather than who is doing it.
