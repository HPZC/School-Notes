## Extreme adjectives and modifiers

### Adjective Gradability

- Adjectives **describe qualities (characteristics) of nouns.** 

- Some qualities **can vary in intensity or "grade",** for example:
  - rather hot, hot, very hot; hot, hotter, the hottest
  - The adjective *hot* is **gradable**.

- Other qualities cannot vary in intensity or grade because they are:

  - extremes (for example: freezing)

  - absolutes (for example: dead)

  - classifying (for example: nuclear)

- The adjectives *freezing*, *dead* and *nuclear* are **non-gradable**.

### Gradable Adjectives

A gradable adjective can also have comparative and superlative forms:

- big, bigger, the biggest
- hot, hotter, the hottest
- important, more important, the most important

Look at these example sentences:

- My teacher was **very happy** with my homework.
- That website is **reasonably popular**. But this one is **more popular**.
- He said that France was **a little cold** and Denmark was **rather cold**. But Sweden was **the coldest**.

### Non-gradable Adjectives

A non-gradable adjective **cannot** be used with grading adverbs:

- It was rather freezing outside.
- The dog was very dead.
- He is investing in slightly nuclear energy.

Non-gradable adjectives do not normally have comparative and superlative forms:

- freezing, more freezing, the most freezing
- dead, deader, the deadest
- nuclear, more nuclear, the most nuclear

Don't try to learn lists of gradable and non-gradable adjectives! It's better to understand what makes an adjective gradable or non-gradable. This is a matter of logic and common sense. Most native-speakers have never heard of gradable and non-gradable adjectives. They just "feel" that it doesn't make sense to say "fairly excellent" or "very unique". You probably have the same idea in your language.

Often, non-gradable adjectives are used alone:

- It was **freezing** outside.
- The dog was **dead**.
- He is investing in **nuclear** energy.

However, a non-gradable adjective **can** be used with "non-grading adverbs" (which usually just give the adjective extra impact), for example:

| non-grading adverbs | non-gradable adjectives |             |
| :------------------ | :---------------------- | :---------- |
| absolutely          | awful                   | extreme     |
| utterly             | excellent               |             |
| completely          | terrified               |             |
| totally             | dead                    | absolute    |
| nearly              | impossible              |             |
| virtually           | unique                  |             |
| essentially         | chemical                | classifying |
| mainly              | digital                 |             |
| almost              | domestic                |             |

Here are some example sentences containing non-grading adverbs with non-gradable adjectives:

- Her exam results were **absolutely awful**. She will have to take the exam again.
- Is there anything like it in the world? It must be **virtually unique**.
- It starts an **essentially chemical** reaction.

### Gradable / Non-gradable Adjectives

Some adjectives may have more than one meaning or sense. It's possible for the same adjective to be gradable with one sense and non-gradable with another sense. For example:

| example sentence                                     | adjective    | sense       |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| He's got a **very old** car.                         | gradable     | not young   |
| I saw my **old** boyfriend yesterday.                | non-gradable | former, ex- |
| He has some **dreadfully common** habits.            | gradable     | vulgar      |
| "The" is a **very common** word in English.          | gradable     | prevalent   |
| The two countries' **common** border poses problems. | non-gradable | shared      |

### Adverbs used with gradable and non-gradable adjectives

The adverbs **really** (very much) and **fairly** and **pretty** (both meaning "to a significant degree, but less than very") can often be used with gradable and non-gradable adjectives:

| gradable                                        | non-gradable                                        |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Please don't forget! It's **really important**. | He was **really terrified**.                        |
| He's a **fairly rich** man.                     | It's a **fairly impossible** job.                   |
| He's **pretty tall**.                           | It's **pretty ridiculous** when you think about it. |

### "Quite" with gradable and non-gradable adjectives

The sense of the adverb "quite" changes according to the gradability of the adjective that we use it with:

|                            | adjective    | sense                  |
| :------------------------- | :----------- | :--------------------- |
| It's **quite warm** today. | gradable     | fairly, rather         |
| Are you **quite certain**? | non-gradable | completely, absolutely |
