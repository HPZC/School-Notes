# Relative pronouns

- Relative pronouns **introduce relative clauses**. 
- The most common relative pronouns are ***who, whom, whose, which, that***. 
- The relative pronoun we use depends on **what we are referring to** and **the type of relative clause**(defining/non-defining).

| pronouns            | usage                                                        | defining/non-defining                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *who*               | people and sometimes pet animals                             | defining and non-defining                                    |
| *which*             | animals and things                                           | defining and non-defining; clause referring to a whole sentence |
| *that*              | people, animals and things; informal                         | defining only                                                |
| *whose*             | possessive meaning;for people and animals usually; sometimes for things in formal situations | defining and non-defining                                    |
| *whom*              | people in formal styles or in writing; often with a preposition; rarely in conversation; used instead of *who* if *who* is the object | defining and non-defining                                    |
| no relative pronoun | when the relative pronoun defines the object of the clause   | defining only                                                |

- *We don’t know <u>the person</u> **who** donated this money.*

- *We drove past <u>my old school</u>, **which** is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.*
- *He went to <u>the school</u> (**that**) my father went to.*
- *<u>The Kingfisher group</u>, **whose** name was changed from Woolworths earlier this year, includes about 720 high street shops. <u>Superdrug</u>, **which** last week announced that it is buying Medicare, is also part of the group.*

- *<u>The parents</u> (**whom/who/that**) we interviewed were all involved in education in some way.

## Relative pronouns: *who*

- We use *who* in relative clauses to **refer to people, and sometimes to pet animals**. 
- We use it to introduce **defining and non-defining relative clauses**:
  - *I think there’d be a lot of children **who**’d love to have a climbing wall in school.* (defining)
  - *That’s the dog **who** doesn’t like me.* (defining; referring to a pet animal)
  - *There’s this guy at work, **who**’s one of my friends, well he’s never been on a train.* (non-defining)

### Subjects and objects

- *Who* can **act as the subject or the object of the relative clause**:
  - *She’s going out with a bloke **who**’s in the army.* (*who* refers to a *bloke* and is the subject of *is* in the relative clause; *bloke* is an informal word for a man)
  - *The woman **who** I saw yesterday was Sheila.* (*who* refers to *the woman* and is the object of *saw* in the relative clause)

### *Who* + prepositions

- We can use *who* as the complement of a preposition:
  - *It was Cath **who** Ian gave the keys <u>to</u>. It wasn’t me.* (*who* refers to *Cath* and is the complement of the preposition *to*)

- We put the preposition at the end of the relative clause, and not immediately before *who*:
  - *Of all my friends, she’s the one **who** I know I can rely on.*
  - Not: ~~… the one on who I know I can rely.~~

### *Who* with collective groups of people

- We often use *who* with **collective human nouns** (e.g. *committee*, *government*, *group*, *panel*, *police*, *team*):
  - *Nicola phoned the fire brigade, **who** then alerted the police and social workers.*


- We **do not use *who* for things**:

  - *There are some very good art books **which** you can get ideas from.*

  - ~~Not: There are some very good art books who you can get ideas from.~~

## Relative pronouns: *whom*

**Warning:**

We use *whom* in formal styles or in writing to refer to people when the person is the object of the verb. It is much more common in writing than in speaking:

> *The response of those managers **whom** I have consulted has been very positive and we are looking forward to meeting together.* (*whom* refers to *those managers* and is the object of *consulted* in the relative clause)

> *She was a celebrated actress **whom** he had known and loved, on and off, almost since her first appearance on the stage.*

### *Whom* + prepositions

The most common use of *whom* is with a preposition. We can use *whom* as the complement of a preposition:

> *The first book was a terrible historical novel for children which was turned down by every publisher **to whom** it was sent.* (*whom* refers to *every publisher* and is the complement of the preposition *to*)

> *Drama in schools is particularly good for pupils **for whom** English is a second language.*

We put the preposition before *whom*.

**Compare**

| more formal                                                  | less formal                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *There was only one person **to whom** the old man spoke.*   | *There was only one person **who** the old man spoke **to**.* |
| *She smiled as she remembered the quiet scholar **with whom** she had shared a love of books.* | *She smiled as she remembered the quiet scholar **who** she had shared a love of books **with**.* |

## Relative pronoun: *whose*

We usually use *whose* as a relative pronoun to indicate possession by people and animals. In more formal styles we can also use it for things.

We use *whose* before nouns instead of a possessive expression (*my, your, his, her, its, our, their, x’s*) in defining and non-defining clauses:

> *He’s marrying a girl **whose** family don’t seem to like him.* (The family of the girl he’s marrying don’t seem to like him.)

> *There was me and there was Kate, **whose** party it was, and then there were two other people.* (It was Kate’s party.)

> *It is a rambling Tudor house, **whose** sitting room looks out over a wonderful walled garden.* (The sitting room of the house looks out over …)

### *Whose* + prepositions

We can use *whose* + noun as the complement of a preposition:

> *Kate, **whose** sister I used to share a house with, has gone to work in Australia.* (*whose sister* refers to *Kate* and is the complement of *with*)

We can put the preposition immediately before the relative pronoun (more formal written styles) or at the end of the relative clause (more informal).

**Compare**



| more formal                                                  | more informal                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Thomas Goldney III, **in whose** house and garden several generations of Bristol students have now lived, was described in the late 18th century as ‘a very curious gentleman’.* | *Thomas Goldney III, **whose** house and garden several generations of Bristol students have now lived **in**, was described in the late 18th century as ‘a very curious gentleman’.* |

## Relative pronouns: *which*

We use *which* in relative clauses to refer to animals and to things. We use it to introduce defining and non-defining relative clauses. We always use *which* to introduce relative clauses when they refer to a whole sentence or clause:

> *You need to tick the box **which** says yes.* (defining)

> *He won’t have much time to prepare for the meeting, **which** is this afternoon.* (non-defining)

> *She had to get up and walk all the way to the other side of the room, **which** isn’t easy with a bad back.* (*which* refers to the whole sentence before it)

We use *which* or *that*, not *what*:

> *Another activity **which**/**that** I have chosen is photography.*

> Not: Another activity what I have chosen is photography.

### Subjects and objects

*Which* can act as the subject or the object of the relative clause:

> *The new sports complex, **which** will be built on the site of the old power station, will provide facilities for cricket, soccer, bowls and badminton.* (*which* refers to *the new sports complex* and is the subject of *will be built* in the relative clause)

> *It was the same picture **which** I saw at the National Gallery.* (*which* refers to *the same picture* and is the object of *saw* in the relative clause)

### *Which* + prepositions

We can use *which* as the complement of a preposition:

> *Early in the Autumn Term there is a reception **at which** you can meet current staff and students.* (*which* refers to *a reception* and is the complement of *at*)

> *Close by, in the churchyard, is the famous Rudston stone, **from which** the village takes its name.* (*which* refers to *the famous Rudston stone* and is the complement of *from*)

We can put the preposition immediately before the relative pronoun (more formal) or at the end of the relative clause (more informal).

**Compare**



| more formal                                                  | more informal                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *The title of the poem indicates that the poet knows himself to be separated from the community **in** **which** he grew up.* | *I’ve never felt close to the community **which** I grew up **in**.* |

### *Which* referring to a whole sentence

Relative clauses referring to a whole sentence are always introduced by *which*:

> *There’s going to be a new headteacher in September, **which** is good. It’s time for a change.*

[talking about a playschool for young children]

> A:
>
> *It’s lovely and clean there, and there are lots of toys that he can play with and he’s so happy.*
>
> B:
>
> ***Which\*** *is much more important*.

## Relative pronouns: *that*

We use *that* instead of *who, whom* or *which* in relative clauses to refer to people, animals and things. We use it to introduce defining clauses only. *That* is more informal than *who, whom* or *which*:

> *We met somebody last night **that** did the speech therapy course two years after you.* (refers to a person)

> *The 8.30 is the train **that** you need to get.* (refers to a thing)

> *She blamed herself for everything **that** had happened.*

### Subjects and objects

*That* can act as the subject or the object of the relative clause:

> *He finally remembers one lesson **that** his mum had taught him early – Don’t take money **that** doesn’t belong to you.* (*that* refers to *money* and is the subject of *belong* in the relative clause)

> *It’s the same cooker **that** my mother has.* (*that* refers to *the same cooker* and is the object of *has* in the relative clause)

### *That* after superlatives

We often use *that* after superlatives:

> *The Wimbledon men’s final was the best game of tennis **that** I’ve ever seen.*

### *That* + prepositions

*That* can refer to the complement of a preposition:

> *We’ve got some tennis balls **that** you can play **with**.* (*that* refers to *some tennis balls* and is the complement of the preposition *with*)

**Warning:**

Unlike *which, whom* and *whose*, we can’t use *that* with the preposition immediately before it:

> Not: We’ve got some tennis balls with that you can play.

## No relative pronoun

In informal styles, we often leave out the relative pronoun. We only do this in defining relative clauses, and when the relative pronoun is the object of the verb. We don’t leave out the relative pronoun when it is the subject of the verb nor in non-defining relative clauses:

> *German is a language **which** I’ve found hard to learn.* (or *German is a language I’ve found hard to learn*.) (defining relative clause: *which* is the object)

> *She’s the singer **who** I heard on the radio.* (or *She’s the singer I heard on the radio*.) (defining relative clause: *who* is the object)

> *There’s a hill **which begins three miles after the start of the race.*** (defining relative clause: *which* is the subject)

> Not: There’s a hill begins three miles after the start of the race.

> *Sir James, **whose** birthday is on February 26, plans to lay on a big party.* (non-defining relative clause)

### No relative pronoun + preposition

In defining relative clauses, we can also leave out the relative pronoun when it is the complement of a preposition. When we do this, we always put the preposition at the end of the relative clause:

> *She was at the garden party **which** I was telling you **about**.* (or *She was at the garden party* ***about which\*** *I was telling you*. or *She was at the garden party I was telling you* ***about\***.) (defining relative clause: *which* is the complement of *about*)

## Relative pronouns: *when*, *where* and *why*

In informal language, we often use *where*, *when* or *why* to introduce defining relative clauses instead of *at which*, *on which* or *for which*.

| *where* | places  | *I know a restaurant **where** the food is excellent.*(… *a restaurant at which the food is excellent*) |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *when*  | times   | *There isn’t a day **when** I don’t feel rushed off my feet.*(*… a day on which I don’t feel rushed …*) |
| *why*   | reasons | *Do you know the reason **why** the shop is closed today?*(*… the reason for which the shop is closed …*) |

## Relative pronouns: typical errors

- We can’t use *that* instead of *who, whom* or *which* in non-defining relative clauses:

> *It gives me a good chance to improve my Italian, **which** has become a little bit rusty.*

> Not: It gives me a good chance to improve my Italian, that has become a little bit rusty.

- We don’t use *what* as a relative pronoun:

> *So, he can make himself easily understood in the two languages, **which** helps a lot.*

> Not: So, he can make himself easily understood in the two languages, what helps a lot.

- We don’t use *who* for things:

> *She’s written some great cookery books **which** have got pictures of delicious-looking recipes.*

> Not: She’s written some great cookery books who have got pictures of delicious-looking recipes.

- Take care to spell *which* correctly: not ‘wich’.

来自[English Grammar Today](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/语法/英式语法/)

## Defining relative clauses

We use defining relative clauses to give essential information about someone or something – information that we need in order to understand what or who is being referred to. A defining relative clause usually comes immediately after the noun it describes.

We usually use a relative pronoun (e.g. *who, that, which, whose* and *whom*) to introduce a defining relative clause (In the examples, the relative clause is in **bold**, and the person or thing being referred to is underlined.):

> *They’re the people **who want to buy our house**.*

> *Here are some cells **which have been affected**.*

> *They should give the money to somebody **who they think needs the treatment most**.*

[talking about an actress]

> *She’s now playing a woman **whose son was killed in the First World War**.*

**Spoken English:**

In defining relative clauses we often use *that* instead of *who, whom* or *which*. This is very common in informal speaking:

> *They’re the people **that** want to buy our house.*

> *Here are some cells **that** have been affected.*

### Subject or object

The relative pronoun can define the subject or the object of the verb:

> *They’re the people **who/that bought our house**.* (The people bought our house. *The people* is the subject.)

> *They’re the people **who/that she met at Jon’s party**.* (She met the people. *The people* is the object.)

> *Here are some cells **which/that show abnormality**.* (Some cells show abnormality. *Some cells* is the subject.)

> *Here are some cells **which/that the researcher has identified**.* (The researcher has identified some cells. *Some cells* is the object.)

### No relative pronoun

We often leave out the relative pronoun when it is the object of the verb:

> *They’re the people **she met at Jon’s party**.*

> *Here are some cells **the researcher has identified**.*

- [No relative pronoun](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/语法/英式语法/relative-pronouns%23relative-pronouns__161)

### Punctuation

**Warning:**

In writing, we don’t use commas in defining relative clauses:

> *This is a man who takes his responsibilities seriously.*

> Not: This is a man, who takes his responsibilities seriously.

### Nouns and pronouns in relative clauses

When the relative pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, we don’t use another personal pronoun or noun in the relative clause because the subject (underlined) is the same:

> *She’s the lady **who** **lent** me her phone.* (*who* is the subject of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun *she*)

> Not: She’s the lady who she lent me her phone.

> *There are now only two schools in the area **that** actually **teach** Latin.* (*that* is the subject of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun *they*)

> Not: There are now only two schools in the area that they actually teach Latin.

When the relative pronoun is the object of the relative clause, we don’t use another personal pronoun or noun in the relative clause because the object (underlined) is the same:

> *We had a lovely meal at the place **which** Phil **recommended**.* (*which* is the object of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun *it*)

> Not: We had a lovely meal at the place which Phil recommended it.

## Non-defining relative clauses

We use non-defining relative clauses to give extra information about the person or thing. It is not necessary information. We don’t need it to understand who or what is being referred to.

We always use a relative pronoun (*who, which, whose* or *whom*) to introduce a non-defining relative clause (In the examples, the relative clause is in **bold**, and the person or thing being referred to is underlined.)

> *Clare, **who I work with**, is doing the London marathon this year.*

> Not: Clare, I work with, is doing the London marathon this year.



> *Doctors use the testing kit for regular screening for lung and stomach cancers, **which account for 70% of cancers treated in the western world**.*

> *Alice, **who has worked in Brussels and London ever since leaving Edinburgh**, will be starting a teaching course in the autumn.*

**Warning:**

We don’t use *that* to introduce a non-defining relative clause:

> *Allen, **who scored three goals in the first game**, was the only player to perform well.*

> Not: Allen, that scored three goals in the first game, was the only player to perform well.

### Punctuation

In writing, we use commas around non-defining relative clauses:

> *Etheridge, **who is English-born with Irish parents**, replaces Neil Francis, **whose injury forced him to withdraw last week**.*

**Spoken English:**

In speaking, we often pause at the beginning and end of the clause:

> *Unlike American firms **– which typically supply all three big American car makers –** Japanese ones traditionally work exclusively with one maker.* (formal)

> *And this woman **– who I’d never met before – came up and spoke to me.*** (informal)

## Defining or non-defining relative clauses?

Sometimes defining and non-defining relative clauses can look very similar but have different meanings.

**Compare**



| non-defining                                                 | defining                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *His brother, **who works at the supermarket**, is a friend of mine.*He has only one brother, and that brother works at the supermarket. | *His brother **who works at the supermarket** is a friend of mine.*He has more than one brother. The one I’m talking about works at the supermarket. |
| *It’s hoped that we will raise £10,000 for local charities, **which help the homeless**.*The money is intended for local charities. All these local charities help the homeless. | *It’s hoped that we will raise £10,000 for local charities **which help the homeless**.*The money is intended for local charities. Some of these local charities help the homeless. There are other local charities as well as these. |

**Warning:**

The information in a defining relative clause is essential, so we can’t leave out the relative clause. The information in a non-defining relative clause is extra information which isn’t essential, so we can leave out the relative clause.

**Compare**

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *The soldier **who had gold stripes on his uniform** seemed to be the most important one.* | A defining relative clause which we can’t leave out; without this information we do not know which soldier the speaker is referring to. |
| *The tour party was weakened when Gordon Hamilton, **who played in the World Cup team**, withdrew yesterday because of a back injury, **which kept him out of the Five Nations Championship**.* | Non-defining relative clauses which we can leave out:*The tour party was weakened when Gordon Hamilton withdrew yesterday because of a back injury*. |

**Warning:**

We can use *that* instead of *who, whom* or *which* in defining relative clauses, but not in non-defining relative clauses:

> *I think anyone **who** speaks in public is nervous beforehand.*

> *I think anyone **that** speaks in public is nervous beforehand.*

> *Her car, **which** was very old, broke down after just five miles.*

> Not: Her car, that was very old, broke down after just five miles.
