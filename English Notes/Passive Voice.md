# Passive Voice

## Active and passive

- We use the terms **active voice and passive voice** to t**alk about ways of organising the content of a clause**.
  - *Cambridge University Press **published** this book.* (active)
  - *This book **was published** by Cambridge University Press.* (passive)

### Active

- The active voice is the typical word order. 
- We **put the subject first**. The subject is the **‘doer’ or agent of the verb**.
- ***Edward Barnes** designed these houses in the 1880s.* (active)

### Passive

- In the passive, **the person or thing that the action was done** to becomes the **topic or theme**. 
- We can **leave out the ‘doer’ or agent**, or we can **place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (*by* + ‘doer’)**
  - ***These houses** were designed in the 1880s.* (passive without agent)
  - ***These houses** were designed in the 1880s by Edward Barnes.* (passive + *by* + agent)

- We use the passive when we want to **change the focus of a clause**, or if **the doer of the verb is not important or not known** or if we **do not want to say who the doer is**.

## Forms

### *Be* + *-ed*

- The most common passive structure is *be* + *-ed* form.
  - *Five million people **watch** the show every week.* (active present simple of *watch*)
  - *The show **is watched** by five million people every week.* (passive present simple of *be + -ed* form of *watch*)

### Tenses and the passive

We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents. For example, we use the present simple in the passive to talk about general or permanent states, or general facts we think are true at the present time:

> *Mr Lloyd and Mrs James **teach** Geography.* (present simple active)

> *Geography **is taught** by Mr Lloyd and Mrs James.* (present simple passive)

We don’t often use perfect continuous forms (*have/has been being* + -*ed* form) in a passive structure. We usually find a way to reword sentences like this.

**Compare**



| *The house **has been being renovated** for almost a year.*  | not common, we usually avoid this form |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| *They **have been renovating** the house for almost a year.* | preferred form                         |

### Verbs and the passive

We can form passive structures with verbs that are followed by an object (transitive verbs) and some clauses where the verb is followed by a preposition:

> *My favourite mug **was broken**.* (Someone broke my favourite mug.)

> *Their car **was broken into** and the radio **was taken**.* (Someone broke into their car and took their radio.)

> *The holiday **hasn’t been paid** **for** yet.* (No one has paid for the holiday yet.)

We can’t make passive forms from verbs which do not have objects (intransitive verbs):

> *The parcel **arrived** in the post this morning.*

> Not: The parcel was arrived …

We don’t usually use the passive with some verbs that describe a state or situation (state verbs):

> *They **were having** lunch.*

> Not: Lunch was being had.

Some verbs are more common in the passive than the active voice. These include *be born, be populated, be stranded, be taken aback*:

> *Where **were** you **born**?*

> *Thousands of passengers **have been stranded** at airports all over Europe after heavy snowfalls.*

### Verbs with two objects

When verbs have two objects, either object can be the theme or subject of the passive structure, depending on what we want to focus on:

> *Her mother **gave** each child a present.* (active)

> *A present **was given** to each child (by her mother).* (passive)

> *Each child **was given** a present (by her mother).* (passive)

### Linking verbs

We don’t form passive structures with verbs like *be, become, seem* where the complement of the verb refers back to the subject (linking verbs):

> *After six years of training she **has** finally **become** a doctor.*
